              Council. ICCIT Council is the official academic society of the ICCIT program at the University of Toronto. We are responsible for creating and executing relevant  events, workshops, and networking opportunities for our students. This year, we created our first ever Creative Case Competition.</p>

            <h3 class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">The Problem</h3>
            <p class="is-size-5">Entering my second year as a CCIT student, I noticed the abundance of case competitions for commerce students and a lack of similar competitions for creative students like myself. I wanted the same opportunities of competing and networking.</p>

            <h3 class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">Research</h3>
            <p class="is-size-5"> Every successful event has an interested market. Therefore, in my third year as the Social and CSR Director, my team and I ran ICCIT's Graphic Design Contest. The event's purpose was to test if there was an interest from our students and act as a small-scale Creative Case Competition. We were pleasantly surprised as we had numerous submissions and high interactions from ICCIT students. </p>

            <h3 class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">The Solution</h3>
            <p class="is-size-5"> After we had concluded there was a market for the Creative Case Competition. My team and I pitched our idea to a top advertising agency in Canada, <a href="https://gdg.agency/">Glen Davis Group</a>. They loved our event and decided to partner with us!</p>
            <p class="is-size-5"> Participants of the Creative Case Competition had to redesign/rebrand a product of a previous Glen Davis' client, <a href="https://www.radicalroadbrew.com/">Radical Road Brewing Co.</a> The winners of the competition would be elligible for a summer internship at the Glen Davis Agency and a monetary prize.</p>

            <h3 class="is-size-4 has-text-weight-bold">Result</h3>
            <p class="is-size-5">The Creative Case Competition had over 50 competitors and was our most popular event of the year. Due to our collective efforts, the highly favoured event resulted in our students finding an internship at a top advertising agency in Canada.</p>
