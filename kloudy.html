          <p class="is-size-6 sm-spacing">Many people who try to quit smoking transfer from traditional cigarettes to E-cigarettes, vapes or other equivalent products. These new &ldquo;tools&rdquo; claim to contain less nicotine and be less harmful to the body. However, without accountability, smokers can be consuming the same, if not more, amount of nicotine. <strong>The Kloudy Vape and app act as accountability tools for users</strong>, as they provide users their daily nicotine consumption, the frequency of vaping sessions, and the times when they smoke. With all the collected information from the Kloudy vape, the app creates progress reports, hence providing users an effective and measurable way of quitting their habit.</p>

          <h3 class="is-size-2 has-text-weight-bold">Research</h3>
          <h2 class="is-size-4">Quantitative Research</h2>
          <p class="is-size-6">According to the Canadian Community Health Survey (Statistics Canada, 2018), it is estimated that there are over 5 million current smokers living in Canada as of 2017. <strong>From these 5 million smokers, 68.0% of them wanted to quit</strong> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="is-size-4">Qualitative Research</h2>
          <p class="is-size-6">My group and I conducted over twenty interviews, asking what users would like to see in our vape and application. Our interviewees were University of Toronto students, that all had over 1+ years of actively vaping. Each interviewee varied in their reason for vaping, some were trying to quit while others vaped as a lifestyle activity.</p>

          <h3 class="is-size-2 has-text-weight-bold">Core Findings</h3>
          <h2 class="is-size-4">Below are direct quotes from our user interviews:</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6">&ldquo;Although I can see the nicotine percentage in a single juul pod, I want to see my <strong>overall nicotine consumption</strong> in an accurate manner.&rdquo;</p>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6">&ldquo;The ability to see the  progress of my <strong>immediate and long-term goals</strong>, would motivate me to quit smoking altogether. Small goals such as decreasing my vaping sessions to twenty a day, would motivate me to complete my long term goal of only consuming 10 mg of nicotine a month.&rdquo;</p>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6">&ldquo;The Kloudy application should have a <strong>socialization feature</strong>, users would be able to interact with other like-minded individuals looking to quit smoking. A successful community will result in accountability partners and add gamification aspect to their journey.&rdquo;</p>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6">&ldquo;The application should be easy to use, incorporating aesthetically pleasing graphics and designs that will <strong>elevate users&rsquo; experience</strong>.&rdquo;</p>

          <h3 class="is-size-2 has-text-weight-bold">Breaking Down the Process</h3>
          <h2 class="is-size-4">The next step was to put the knowledge from research in motion to define the app's functions, user flows and design the prototype.</h2>
          <p class="is-size-6"><strong>Application Functions</strong></p>
          <ul>

            <li>View Long-Term Goals</li>
            <li>Kloudy Community</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6"><strong>Vape Functions</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pair to application using Bluetooth</li>
            <li>Simple LCD Screen, displaying information such as battery life, # of vaping sessions, and nicotine intensity</li>
            <li>Traditional shape of vape</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6"><strong>Users' Flow</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p class="is-size-6">By understanding the core findings, we created a low fidelity user flow using Balsamiq. The order of wireframes represent the typical user journey, as they navigate through our app.</p>

          <h3 class="is-size-2 has-text-weight-bold">User Testing</h3>
          <h2 class="is-size-4">University of Toronto students volunteered to test our prototypes.</h2>
          <p class="is-size-6">Usability tests took place in CC3160 in the Communication, Culture &amp; Technology building At the University of Toronto Mississauga. </p><br>
          <p class="is-size-6"><strong>Lo fidelity, mid fidelity, and high-fidelity prototypes</strong> of our “Kloudy” vape and application were administered to participants for the study. We used true experiments including <strong>keystroke recording and thinking aloud protocols</strong>. Using these experiments we were able to collect detailed results. Keystroke recording showed how users navigate through our app and the thinking aloud protocols allowed us to see and hear the associated behaviours/opinions of our product.</p><br>
          <p class="is-size-6">Furthermore, in more detailed prototypes we gave participants different scenarios. Each scenario had a <strong>list of tasks</strong> such as pairing your Kloudy vape, navigating to the “user tracking” subsection of the application, and editing “long-term goals”. The observations from each scenario, acted as guidance for our innovations.</p>

                <li><strong>Bluetooth Indicator</strong></li>
				  <p>The LCD screen of the vape did not have a Bluetooth icon. Users wanted a lit up Bluetooth icon on the screen, once they were successfully paired to the app.</p><br>
                <li><strong>"Sessions" Jargon</strong></li>
				  <P>Many users were confused about the "Sessions" jargon. We had to explain to our users, that a session was a "drag" of 1 to 3 seconds from the vape.</P>

<p><strong>Current Usage</strong></p>
				<p>Our first "Current Usage" page did not meet all the requirements of most users. They wanted to the targeted # of puffs to see if they were on track. The graphic visualization helped see this progress but not accurately. Moreover, users wanted the ability to view and edit goals from the "Current Usage" page. They found the process redundant to navigate back to the account page to edit this.</p>

                <li><strong>Battery percentage</strong></li>

<p><strong>Redundant Home Button</strong></p>
				<p>In our second prototype a major change was the addition of the "back" button on all our pages. In the previous prototype, we only had the "Kloudy" home button for users to visit other pages. 85% of users mentioned that without the "back" button, they found navigating through our app too linear. </p>

          <p class="is-size-6">The Kloudy team sought to create a product that fit the needs of users looking to cut their nicotine consumption using non-cigarette alternatives. By identifying the demands of the product target market as well as conducting a slew usability evaluations, the team was able to consistently re-iterate and implement more effective design functions, ultimately leading to the release of the final Kloudy Vape and Accountability application.</p>
          <p class="is-size-6">Prioritizing certain iterations over others was a long process of trial and error, documenting which changes positively benefitted the users. This four month long project, resulted in users being<strong> 33% more efficient with the given tasks</strong> (i.e. editing their long-term goals) and an increase in satisfaction with our overall design.</p>
