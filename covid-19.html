        <p>Entering the UX industry, I had so many questions.</p><br>
        <p>With coffee chats out the door, Google Calendar and Zoom became my best friends.</p><br>
        <p>During this time I reached out to various User Experience Designers, Product Managers, Product Designers and
          User Researchers.</p><br>
        <p>Every conversation was so fruitful, as I always learned something new. My
          one dimensional understanding of design became deeper with each unique perspective. One question
          I always asked was:</p><br>
          <p><span class="question">"What is one of your favourite design books, documentaries, or

                <p>My favourite "design" book well, design books are generally pretty bad. One of my favourites that I
                  learned a lot from was: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35631386-the-undoing-project"
                    target="_blank">The
                    Undoing Project</a> by Michael Lewis. It's a psychology book but I found it
                  very insightful at the time. One of my favourite podcasts is <a href="https://userdefenders.com/"
                    target="_blank">User
                    Defenders</a>, which provides a fresh
                  look at design problems that aren't just in the digital world. <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/rams"
                    target="_blank">Rams</a> the 2018 documentary would have
                  to be one of my favourites. It's heavily rooted in Industrial Design, but it's a classic.</p>

                <p>To answer your question, I actually haven't read any design books nor listen to any design-related
                  podcasts (yet!) but I did enjoy a documentary called <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/objectified"
                    target="_blank">Objectified</a> by Gary Hustwit. It explores the
                  ways in which the objects in our everyday lives tell us about what we value. He explores the idea
                  that, in a way, the things we purchase aren't just bought for fun, but rather because they help us
                  "achieve a goal" - whether it's to feel calm, to satisfy our hunger, or to improve the way we feel
                  about our physical appearance. This also branches off into a conversation about what good design
                  looks like in objects, and how our favourite objects in our lives are the ones that we often don't
                  notice because they do exactly what we need them to do, without fuss. :D</p>

                  book teaches you how to make the most of your design critiques, but it doesn't just end there. A lot
                  of what you learn can be applied to any situation where you're communicating your ideas.</p>

                <p>I find a lot of inspiration from watching documentaries or mini-series on designers and artists. It
                  allows us a glimpse into their thought process and reveals how they see and interpret the world. And,
                  it's always fascinating to discover the stories behind everyday objects in our lives. Some of my

                <p>A design book that I picked up recently during the pandemic is from Takashi Murakami called “<a
                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42992837-the-octopus-eats-its-own-leg" target="_blank">The
                    Octopus Eats Its Own Leg</a>”. It’s a book that showcases Murakami’s artwork from his paintings and
                  sculptures featured in exhibits around the world to his more recent designs that have become embedded
                  in fashion and pop culture. For me personally it’s a book that demonstrates the intersections between
                  design and art. As someone with practices in both disciplines it’s a great source of inspiration when
                  approaching my work.</p>

              <div class="content">
                <p>Early on in my design career, I wanted to learn everything about design. As someone who is more
                  research oriented, I felt the need to prove to others that I was capable of excelling in every facet
                  of UX design. There was a period of time where all I consumed were design books, documentaries, and
                  podcasts, but I can't say that any of them in particular stood out or attributed to a positive
                  change in my career. That was not until I started watching <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg" target="_blank">Ali Abdaal's</a>
                  videos on YouTube.
                  Ali is a
                  doctor and Cambridge graduate whose content is primarily centered around how to maximize
                  productivity in your life. He presents strategies and tips that enable you to work smarter and not
                  harder and that made me realize that everything that I wanted to learn about design should be
                  focused and intentional, and that the lack thereof was causing me to feel burnt out and overwhelmed.
                  In these times where everything feels so mundane, it's very easy to fall into a certain type of work
                  or way of doing things. And ultimately you lose your sense of purpose and goal. While his content
                  isn't "design related" persay, I find that anything that allows me to self-reflect which includes,
                  evaluating, assessing, and potentially realigning what I am doing and how I am doing things, which
                  is fundamental to ensuring that whatever I'm learning, design or not, is fruitful. </p>

                  PM/design content. I think it’s a path less travelled but it allows one to create an authentic
                  perspective on design and for me, allows me to bring my genuine self to work each day. Also humans
                  need some nonsense time and I already spend too much time working lol!</p>

                  by Daniel Kahneman. It talks about how we as humans all
                  have our own innate biases. We think we are making the right choice or decision based on familiarity
                  or aesthetic pleasure. However, this book has taught me that as a designer, we need to go beyond these
                  biases in order to make the right decisions. This is an idea that I'm constantly trying to implement
                  as I make decisions, not just in design but also in my everyday choices!</p>

                <p>To be completely honest I haven’t really read, listened or watched much of anything related to design
                  since getting into design last summer.</p>
                <p>Albeit, if you count Medium articles, that’s my main design resource. I enjoy the ease of use and the
                  little time stamps so I know how long pursuing an article would take me and highlighting important
                  takeaways.</p>
                <p>But now that I’ve finished work I’ve been recommended to the Methods podcast by <a
                    href="https://design.google/library/podcasts/" target="_blank">Google Design</a> so I’ll
                  be starting that this week :)</p>
                <p>As for design inspiration in general I think I derive a lot of inspiration for UI elements through
                  observing artwork in museums or even palettes that I see in my day to day. For example, I went to a
                  cafe a week ago that served me a cold drink in a cobalt blue paper cup with a forest green lid and
                  peachy coloured straw and I instantly fell in love with that combination and have included it on my
                  mood board for my new startup project.</p>
